<span id="id1"></span><h1>Dynamic Membership<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-membership" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Dynamic Membership is an extension to the Babble protocol, which enables peers
to join or leave a live cluster via consensus. Until now, we had only
considered fixed peer-sets, where the list of participants was predetermined
and unchanged throughout the life of a Babble network. This was an important
limitation, hindering the formation of ad-hoc blockchains as we envision them.
Here we present our solution, and its implementation, which relies on previous
work regarding the Hashgraph-to-Blockchain projection, and FastSync.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="../_images/dyn_part.png" src="../_images/dyn_part.png" />
<p>A Babble node is started with a genesis peer-set (genesis.peers.json) and a
current peer-set (peers.json). If its public-key does not belong to the current
peer-set, the node will enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Joining</span></code> state, where it will attempt to
join the peer-set. It does so by signing an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">InternalTransaction</span></code> and
submitting it for consensus via a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">JoinRequest</span></code> to one of the current nodes.</p>
<p>The InternalTransaction is added to an Event, and goes through Babble
consensus, until it is added to a block and committed. However, unlike regular
transactions, the InternalTransaction is actually interpreted by Babble to
modify the peer-set, if the application-layer accepts it. We shall see that,
according to Hashgraph dynamics, an accepted InternalTransaction, committed
with round-received R, only affects peer-sets for rounds R+6 and above.</p>
<p>If the JoinRequest was successful, and the new node makes it into the peer-set,
it will either enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Babbling</span></code> state directly, or the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CatchingUp</span></code>
state, depending on whether the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fast-sync</span></code> flag was provided. In the former
case, the node will have to retrieve the entire history of the hashgraph and
commit all the blocks it missed one-by-one. This is where it is important to
have the genesis peer-set, to allow the joining node to validate the consensus
decisions and peer-set changes from the beginning of the hashgraph.</p>
<p>The functionality for removing peers is almost identical, with the difference
that there will be an automatic way of deciding when nodes should be removed,
based on a minimum level of activity (ex: 10 rounds with no witnesses). As of
today, a node submits a LeaveRequest for itself upon capturing a SIGINT signal
when the Babble process is terminated cleanly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="internaltransaction">
<h2>InternalTransaction<a class="headerlink" href="#internaltransaction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In contrast with regular transactions, which only affect the application layer,
InternalTransactions are internal to Babble. Babble acts upon
InternalTransactions to modify part of its own state, the peer-set, rather than
modifying the application’s state. However, the application layer plays a role
in accepting or refusing peer-set changes during the block commit phase. For
example, the application could refuse all InternalTransactions (thereby
preventing the peer-set from ever changing), or accept only up to N
participants, or finally, it could base the decision on a predefined whitelist;
anything goes, as long as the rule is deterministic (all nodes make the same
decision).</p>

<div class="section" id="peerset">
<h2>PeerSet<a class="headerlink" href="#peerset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Until now, the peer-set has been a static list of peers; we now associate each
Hashgraph round with a potentially different peer-set. We maintain a sorted
table of round-to-peer-set associations, such that all rounds between two
consequent entries of this table are associated with the left-most peer-set.
For example, if the table of peer-sets is [{0, PS1}, {5, PS2}, {12, PS3}], then
rounds 0 to 4 will be associated to peer-set PS1, rounds 5 to 11 will be
associated to PS2, and rounds 12 and above will be associated to PS3 (until the
peer-set changes again).</p>
<p>We will see in the next section how to account for different peer-sets in the
core consensus methods, but since they are allowed to change from one round to
another, peer-sets must also be accounted for in the Frame and Block
data-structures. Indeed, when verifying a Block, one must know which peer-set to
count signatures against. Therefore, we have extended the Frame and Block
objects to contain a PeerSetHash, that uniquely identifies the peer-set of the
corresponding round-received. In the future, we will need to include a proof of
peer-set change inside the Blocks, so that clients may follow and verify the
evolution of the peer-set; ie, something that captures the following
information:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>PS0 + InternalTransaction0 + PS0-signatures(InternalTransaction0) =&gt; PS1

<h2>Algorithm Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm-updates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is no better documentation than the code itself, but here is a high level
overview of what has changed. This section assumes familiarity with Babble, and
Hashgraph.</p>
<div class="section" id="stronglysee">
<h3>StronglySee<a class="headerlink" href="#stronglysee" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Informally, StronglySee is the function that determines whether there is a path
in the Hashgraph connecting two Events such that the path includes Events from
a strong majority of participants. This obviously begs the question: “strong
majority of which set of participants?”. So we extended the StronglySee method
with a PeerSet parameter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="round">
<h3>Round<a class="headerlink" href="#round" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An Event’s round is determined by taking the max of its parents rounds, and
adding 1 if, and only if, the Event can strongly-see a super-majority of
Witnesses from that round (max of the parents). So, in this call to
StronglySee, we pass the peer-set corresponding to the max parent round, and
the super-majority is counted based on the max parent round peer-set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="witness">
<h3>Witness<a class="headerlink" href="#witness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h3>Fame<a class="headerlink" href="#fame" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With Dynamic Membership, different peer-sets may be involved in deciding the
fame of a single witness. Although, Babble’s implementation of the Hashgraph
algorithm is slightly different, here are the changes that Dynamic Membership
introduce in the algorithm as described in the original Hashgraph whitepaper:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>for each event x in order from earlier rounds to later

          d ← y . round - x . round
          s ← the set of witness events in round y . round -1 that y can strongly see
  **     [based on y.round-1 peer-set]
          v ← majority vote in s ( is TRUE for a tie )
          t ← number of events in s with a vote of v

          if d = 1 // first round of the election
              y . vote ← can y see x ?
          else
  **          [n ←  number of peers in y.round peer-set]
              if d mod c &gt; 0 // this is a normal round
                  if t &gt; 2* n /3 // if supermajority, then decide
                      x . famous ← v

<h3>R+6<a class="headerlink" href="#r-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When an InternalTransaction is committed, when should we start counting the new
peer-set in order to guarantee that all correct nodes will do the same thing?
The answer is R+6 where R is the round-received of the Event containing the
InternalTransaction.</p>
<p>We need only determine the lower-bound because the goal is obviously to change
the peer-set as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The solution is basically contained in Lemmas 5.15 and 5.17 of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf">original
hashgraph whitepaper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Lemma 5.15.
If hashgraphs A and B are consistent, and A decides a Byzantine agreement
election with result v in round r and B has not decided prior to r, then
B will decide v in round r + 2 or before.</p>
<p>Lemma 5.17.
For any round number r, for any hashgraph that has at least one event in
round r+3, there will be at least one witness in round r that will be
decided to be famous by the consensus algorithm, and this decision will be
made by every witness in round r + 3, or earlier.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If one hashgraph decides RoundReceived = R, then a strong majority of round R
witnesses are decided, and by Lemma 5.17 they are necessarily decided in round
R+3 or earlier. Hence, by Lemma 5.15, any other consistent hashgraph will have
decided by round R + 5 or earlier. It is then safe to set the new peer-set for
round R + 6.</p>
