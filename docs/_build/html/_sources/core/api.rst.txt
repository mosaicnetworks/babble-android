API
===

As mentioned in the :ref:`design` section, Babble communicates with the App
through an ``AppProxy`` interface, which exposes three methods for Babble to
call the App. Here we explain how to implement this API.

**Note**: The Snapshot and Restore methods of the API are still work in
progress. They are necessary for the :ref:`fastsync` protocol which is not
completely ready yet. It is safe to just implement stubs for these methods.

Inmem
-----

The ``InmemProxy`` uses native callback handlers to enable Babble to call
methods on the App directly. Applications need only implement the
``ProxyHandler`` interface and pass that to an ``InmemProxy``.

Here is a quick example of how to use Babble as an in-memory engine (in the
same process as your handler):

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
      "github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble/src/babble"
      "github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble/src/crypto"
      "github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble/src/hashgraph"
      "github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble/src/proxy/inmem"
    )

    // Implements proxy.ProxyHandler interface
    type Handler struct {
      stateHash []byte
    }

    // Called when a new block is committed by Babble. This particular example
    // just computes the stateHash incrementaly with incoming blocks, and accepts
    // all InternalTransactions
    func (h *Handler) CommitHandler(block hashgraph.Block) (stateHash []byte, err error) {
      hash := h.stateHash

      for _, tx := range block.Transactions() {
        hash = crypto.SimpleHashFromTwoHashes(hash, crypto.SHA256(tx))
      }

      h.stateHash = hash

      receipts := []hashgraph.InternalTransactionReceipt{}
      for _, it := range block.InternalTransactions() {
        r := it.AsAccepted()
        receipts = append(receipts, r)
      }

      response := proxy.CommitResponse{
        StateHash:                   h.stateHash,
        InternalTransactionReceipts: receipts,
      }

      return response, nil
    }

    // Called when syncing with the network
    func (h *Handler) SnapshotHandler(blockIndex int) (snapshot []byte, err error) {
      return []byte{}, nil
    }

    // Called when syncing with the network
    func (h *Handler) RestoreHandler(snapshot []byte) (stateHash []byte, err error) {
      return []byte{}, nil
    }

    func NewHandler() *Handler {
      return &Handler{}
    }

    func main() {

      config := babble.NewDefaultConfig()

      // To use babble as an internal engine we use InmemProxy.
      proxy := inmem.NewInmemProxy(NewHandler(), config.Logger)

      config.Proxy = proxy

      // Create the engine with the provided config
      engine := babble.NewBabble(config)

      // Initialize the engine
      if err := engine.Init(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
      }

      // Submit a transaction directly through the Proxy
      go func() { proxy.SubmitTx([]byte("some content")) }()

      // This is a blocking call
      engine.Run()
    }

Socket
------

The ``SocketProxy`` is simply a TCP server that accepts `SubmitTx` requests,
and calls remote methods on the App through a JSON-RPC interface. The App is
therefore expected to implement its own component to send out SubmitTx requests
through TCP, and receive JSON-RPC messages from the remote Babble node.

The advantage of using a TCP interface is that it provides the freedom to
implement the application in any programming language. The specification of the
JSON-RPC interface is provided below, but here is an example of how to use our
Go implementation, ``SocketBabbleProxy``, to connect to a remote Babble node.

Assuming there is a Babble node running with its proxy listening on
``127.0.0.1:1338`` and configured to speak to an App at ``127.0.0.1:1339``
(these are the default values):

.. code:: go

    package main

    import (
      "time"

      "github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble/src/crypto"
      "github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble/src/hashgraph"
      "github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble/src/proxy/socket/babble"
    )

    // Implements proxy.ProxyHandler interface
    type Handler struct {
      stateHash []byte
    }

    // Called when a new block is comming. This particular example just computes
    // the stateHash incrementaly with incoming blocks
    func (h *Handler) CommitHandler(block hashgraph.Block) (stateHash []byte, err error) {
      hash := h.stateHash

      for _, tx := range block.Transactions() {
        hash = crypto.SimpleHashFromTwoHashes(hash, crypto.SHA256(tx))
      }

      h.stateHash = hash

      receipts := []hashgraph.InternalTransactionReceipt{}
      for _, it := range block.InternalTransactions() {
        r := it.AsAccepted()
        receipts = append(receipts, r)
      }

      response := proxy.CommitResponse{
        StateHash:                   h.stateHash,
        InternalTransactionReceipts: receipts,
      }

      return response, nil
    }

    // Called when syncing with the network
    func (h *Handler) SnapshotHandler(blockIndex int) (snapshot []byte, err error) {
      return []byte{}, nil
    }

    // Called when syncing with the network
    func (h *Handler) RestoreHandler(snapshot []byte) (stateHash []byte, err error) {
      return []byte{}, nil
    }

    func NewHandler() *Handler {
      return &Handler{}
    }

    func main() {
      // Connect to the babble proxy at :1338 and listen on :1339.
      // The Handler ties back to the application state.
      proxy, err := babble.NewSocketBabbleProxy("127.0.0.1:1338", "127.0.0.1:1339", NewHandler(), 1*time.Second, nil)
          // Verify that it can listen
      if err != nil {
        panic(err)
      }

      // Verify that it can connect and submit a transaction
      if err := proxy.SubmitTx([]byte("some content")); err != nil {
        panic(err)
      }

      // Wait indefinitly
      for {
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
      }
    }

Example SubmitTx request (from App to Babble):

.. code:: http

  request: {"method":"Babble.SubmitTx","params":["Y2xpZW50IDE6IGhlbGxv"],"id":0}
  response: {"id":0,"result":true,"error":null}


Note that the Proxy API is **not** over HTTP; It is raw JSON over TCP. Here is
an example of how to make a SubmitTx request manually:

.. code:: go

  printf "{\"method\":\"Babble.SubmitTx\",\"params\":[\"Y2xpZW50IDE6IGhlbGxv\"],\"id\":0}" | nc -v  172.77.5.1 1338


Example CommitBlock request (from Babble to App):

.. code:: http

  request:
        {
            "method": "State.CommitBlock",
            "params": [
                {
                "Body": {
                    "Index": 0,
                    "RoundReceived": 7,
                    "StateHash": null,
                    "FrameHash": "gdwRCdwxoyLUyzzRK6N31rlJFBJu5By/vDk5gSQHJHQ=",
                    "Transactions": [
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHg5",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHgx",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHgy",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHgz",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHg0",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHg1",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHg2",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHg3",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHg4",
                    "Tm9kZTEgVHgxMA=="
                    ]
                },
                "Signatures": {}
                }
            ],
            "id": 0
        } 

  response: {"id":0,"result":{"Hash":"6SKQataObI6oSY5n6mvf1swZR3T4Tek+C8yJmGijF00="},"error":null}

The content of the request's "params" is the JSON representation of a Block
with a RoundReceived of 7 and 10 transactions. The transactions themselves are
base64 string encodings.

The response's Hash value is the base64 representation of the application's
State-hash resulting from processing the block's transaction sequentially.
